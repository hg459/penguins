## Data

This data set includes information like bill length, flipper length, body mass, sex, and island for the three different species pictured above. 

## Single trait distribution


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = island, y = sex))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = island, y = bill_length_mm, color = sex), shape=1) 
```
The penguins on Torgersen island appear to have the shortest bill lengths. Interestingly enough, there does not appear to be a difference 

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill=species)) +
  facet_wrap(~species, nrow=3)
```

## Relationship between mutliple traits

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y=bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
There is a positive relationship between bill length and body mass in grams. As the body mass increases for each species of penguin, the bill length also increases. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species), shape=1) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))
```

## Sexual dimorphism

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = sex, color = species), shape=1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g))
```

Males have a larger body mass in grams than females. 


```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g))
